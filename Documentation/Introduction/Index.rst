Introduction
============

The extension allows you to build media galleries containing images, videos,
and/or 3D models. This is achieved by extending TYPO3's native file storage.
In the frontend, media archives consist of gallery views and single views as
well as a plugin to display sets of images on other pages.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
