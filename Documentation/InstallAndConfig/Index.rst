1.  Install the extension

    Add the package name to your ``composer.json`` or install the package
    manually.

2.  Set up storage

    Set up a file storage in order to store media files. Further information
    on the set-up process can be found in the official TYPO3 documentation.

3.  Optionally set up a data folder

    In a blank folder in your page tree, add a ``FileCollection``. Further
    data, such as agents, needs to be located in the same data folder.
