=========
CHF Media
=========

The extension provides a data model for media-centric data, as part of the
Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF). This mainly extends TYPO3's own file
metadata to include, for example, revision information and the ability to add
labels and licences as well as structured authorship relations. In addition,
file collections can be annotated to not just structure files, which could
also be achieved via labels, but to allow for virtual exhibitions.
